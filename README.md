# ⛄ Cozy Winter Game by Beside Central

**Cozy Winter Game by Beside Central** is a cozy, winter-themed game created in just a few days for the [Cozy Winter Jam 2026](https://itch.io/jam/cozy-winter-jam-2026). 

Embracing the jam's themes of **Winter** and **Reflection**, this project aims to provide players with a relaxing and atmospheric experience to unwind with on a cold winter day.

The game is at the beginning quite diffucult. You have to smelt down the nuts to buy more stuff in the shop. 
Every nut you get makes you much stronger and you get more and more.
